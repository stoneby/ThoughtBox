transfrom.collider.bounds (all in world position)
- center: center of collider
- extents: half of size of collider according to center.

boxcollider (all in related position, just what you seen in inspector, no caring about transform properties like position / scale / rotation.)
- center:
- extents:
- size:

Note:
renderer.bounds
collider.bounds  are all read only.

if you call like this:
renderer.bounds.Encapsulate(new Vector3(1, 1, 1)); // nothing gonna happen to the object bounds belongs to. The change things is temp bounds.

After combine bounds we need to set offset of current combined game object, z order should be higher priority from children.
- In this example, offset of Z.
