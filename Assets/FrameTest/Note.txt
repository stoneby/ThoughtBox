Animation Stuff:

Clip wrap mode:
- Once: Play once stop when finish.
- ClampForever: Play once, always sampling the last frame. (ps. looks same with Once mode, but animation is not on stop status)

Animation state:
! To set animation state from internal.
- time: Sample animation on specific time.

+ Usage 1.
Say we have a 60 frame rate animation, 1-20: idle 21-40 walk, 41-60 jump.
animation["Example"].time = 0 / 3; // Sample at idle part.
animation["Example"].time = 1 / 3; // Sample at walk part.

- speed: To control animation speed.
animation["Example"].speed = 0; // To sample exactly the specific frame.

+ Usage 2.
That we know current time, we want to start specific animation part.
Usually we have some logic on Update(), the time is not exactly to hit animation's frame, we need to know which part animation we are playing.

if (deltaTime > 0 && deltaTime <= 1 / 3)
{
	// we are in idle state.
	// do sth.
}

Note:
Animation in loop style pay attention.
! Say spinning stuff that using buffer to approach spinning effect with one same animation.
! For short our reel spin as example.

Animation stop by time reach to animation length. The last frame of animation is usually hit when the current frame time is beyond animation's supposing time use.

Ideal frame scene.
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- Stop 
0  10 20 30 40 50 60

Reality frame scene.
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- stop
0  12 21 31 42 49 64	
0  12 21 31 42 49 58 70

Key point: the last frame looking is not that smooth, if speed is high I think. Of every spin circle.
